# Ensure that you have both beautifulsoup and requests installed:
#   pip install beautifulsoup4
#   pip install requests

import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Using the requests module, we use the "get" function
# provided to access the webpage provided as an
# argument to this function:
result = requests.get("https://www.google.com/")

# To make sure that the website is accessible, we can
# ensure that we obtain a 200 OK response to indicate
# that the page is indeed present:
print("Status code: ", result.status_code)
print('\n')
# For other potential status codes you may encounter,
# consult the following Wikipedia page:
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes

# We can also check the HTTP header of the website to
# verify that we have indeed accessed the correct page:
print("Headers: \n", result.headers)
print('\n')
# For more information on HTTP headers and the information
# one can obtain from them, you may consult:
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields

# Now, let us store the page content of the website accessed
# from requests to a variable:
src = result.content

# Now that we have the page source stored, we will use the
# BeautifulSoup module to parse and process the source.
# To do so, we create a BeautifulSoup object based on the
# source variable we created above:
soup = BeautifulSoup(src, 'lxml')

# Now that the page source has been processed via Beautifulsoup
# we can access specific information directly from it. For instance,
# say we want to see a list of all of the links on the page:
links = soup.find_all("a")
print("All of the html a tags, which are links on the page.\n", links)
print("\n")

# Perhaps we just want to extract the link that has contains the text
# "About" on the page instead of every link. We can use the built-in
# "text" function to access the text content between the <a> </a>
# tags.
for link in links:
    if "About" in link.text:
        print(link)
        print(link.attrs['href'])
