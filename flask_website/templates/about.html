    <p>We are a team of college developers who joined together from different universities to create a helpful project during the COVID-19 pandemic. We created this project as a part of the hackathon ran by <a href="https://minorityprogrammers.org/covid.html">MPA: Minority Programmers Association. </a>With supplies running low in stores during the pandemic, our vision with this website was to be able to display commonly needed items such as toilet paper, soap, and hand sanitizer more easily. This would allow people to quickly search different stores and find the items that everyone is looking for during these times. Our current website is web scraping data with beautiful soup for python and our webpage is running on flask. We currently have our scraper working successfully for Samâ€™s Club. Check out our github <a href="https://github.com/AustinWongParker/Hackathon_WebScraper">here!</a></p>
    <p>Thank you for checking out our page, please stay safe and healthy!</p>
