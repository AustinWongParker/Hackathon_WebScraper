          <!--<h class="w3-margin w3-large"> The goal of our project is to have a portable, accessible, and simple website that can be accessed by anyone with
               browser. This website is scraped using python's beautiful soup and helps tackle a common COVID-19 problem:
               Is there essential supplies at this store and/or location. </h>
           <h>With our website, we scraped the essential information for TP, soap, and hand sanitizer. We display the price of the
               item very easily on the site. This allows for transparency and helps people that cannot access these stores (in our case Sam's Club) find
               prices to essential items very quickly.</h>

    <h6>We are a team of college developers who joined together from different universities to create a helpful project during the COVID-19 pandemic. We created this project as a part of the hackathon ran by <a href="https://minorityprogrammers.org/covid.html">MPA: Minority Programmers Association.</a> With supplies running low in stores during the pandemic, our vision with this website was to be able to display commonly needed items such as toilet paper, soap, and hand sanitizer more easily. This would allow people to quickly search different stores and find the items that everyone is looking for during these times. Our current website is web scraping data with beautiful soup for python and our webpage is running on flask. We currently have our scraper working successfully for Samâ€™s Club.
