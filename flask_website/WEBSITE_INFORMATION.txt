Deployment Information
----------------------
4/24/2020
~~~~~~~~~
After reviewing options for deployment, we tried Linode linux servers and Heroku cloud services.
Both didn't work completely how we wanted it to. Linode gave us routing errors for our Tp | soap | hand Sanitizer.
Heroku was able to deploy. You can see it here: https://hackathon-webscraper.herokuapp.com/ HOWEVER, the routing for the
tp | soap | hand Sanitizer is messed up. We spent numerous hours trying to deploy it online, though the routing of our flask application did not allow for it.
In conclusion, we did NOT deploy on the web. You'll have to run the flask application locally to view all our changes. This will produce the best results :)

Running the webscraper to display data on website (FOR TESTING):
1. Have flask run going (prob in debug mode to test)
2. run samsclub_scraper.py once (This will scrap the site and put into csv)
3. run csv_to_html.py once (This will take csv and make it into html)
4. Boom. Now the separate html pages in templates should render the csv-->html on their respective pages.
